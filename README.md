# Online-Vault2
This is the download for my vault due to the website not being a great way of showing my notes, nor can I properly show my notes due to my inexperience.

# How to download
To download please click on the <> code, then click on download zip.

After that please download https://obsidian.md/ 

Then unzip the zip file by extracting folder, then open the folder in Obsidian.
